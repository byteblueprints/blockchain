# ByteBlueprints: Blockchain Implementation from Scratch

Welcome to the ByteBlueprints project! This repository is dedicated to building a complete blockchain implementation from the ground up, with a strong focus on education, clarity, and modularity. Every component is explained, visualized, and coded step by step, making it an ideal resource for learners, educators, and contributors.

## Project Goals
- **Educational:** Demystify blockchain technology by breaking it into understandable, well-documented modules.
- **From Scratch:** No hidden libraries—every core algorithm and data structure is implemented and explained.
- **Visual:** Use animations and diagrams to make complex concepts intuitive.
- **Modular:** Each cryptographic and blockchain component is its own module, easy to study and extend.

## Repository Structure

- `01.Introduction/` — Project overview, learning path, and foundational concepts.
- `02.SHA256/` — Bitwise operations and SHA-256 hash function (see below).
- *(More modules coming soon: Merkle trees, block structure, consensus, networking, wallets, etc.)*

## SHA-256 Module
The `02.SHA256/` directory contains:
- Python implementations of all bitwise operations used in SHA-256
- Manim visualizations for each operation
- In-depth documentation for every step

See [`02.SHA256/README.md`](02.SHA256/README.md) for details and usage.

## Roadmap
- [x] SHA-256 bitwise operations (SHR, ROTR, XOR, ADD)
- [ ] Full SHA-256 hash function
- [ ] Merkle tree construction and proofs
- [ ] Block structure and validation
- [ ] Peer-to-peer networking basics
- [ ] Consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Work)
- [ ] Wallets and transactions
- [ ] Full blockchain node
